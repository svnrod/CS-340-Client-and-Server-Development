How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is an integral focus point of development. Some ways we can ensure we are writing code that is readable, adaptable, and maintable is by adhering to the best programming practices taught to you, such as correct naming conventions, readable flow of code, and well commented code. With these practices in mind, I was able to develop the dashboard with made the development of the dashboard and the readability of it much easier.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- As a computer scientist and developer, you must attack any problem iteratively. Developing iteratively and tackling smaller tasks one by one will assist any developer in being able to better understand the problem and come up with a solution in an efficient manner. This was the most technique I used for the development of this dashboard, as we were tasked to slowly and iteratively develop our code for the project week by week.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer Scientists are people who solve complex problems using their teachings in mathematics, computation, and engineering. These Computer Scientists may also be tasked with developing intricate computer and database systems using meaninful data. Computer Scientists and Developers are perfect to solve the type of problem Grazioso Salvare are looking to solve. Using a Computer Scientist will ease the process of developing a dashboard for their system.
